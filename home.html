						<h2>The importance of blood donation</h2>
						<h3>1. Less Than 10% of Eligible Donors Do</h3>
						<p><font size="4px">Blood donation is a safe process, regulated by the Food and Drug Administration to make sure the donor, blood supply and recipient stay protected.</font></p>
						<h3>2. It Saves Lives</h3>
						<p><font size="4px">Donations are essential for trauma patients and people undergoing a variety of situations, including surgeries, transplants, chronic illnesses, blood disorders and cancer. Because over 90% of people who are eligible to donate do not, there’s always a need for donors.</font></p>
						<p><font size="4px">“Life-saving blood components can support recovery from injuries or disease”. “A single blood donation can give one to four patients a better outcome, a chance at survival.”   </font></p>
						<h3>3. It’s Only an Hour of Your Time</h3>
						<p><font size="4px">The entire donation process takes approximately one hour, with about 10 minutes of that time being the actual blood donation. The whole blood donation volume is usually about 500 milliliters, or one pint.</font></p>
						<h3>4. There’s Little Pain Involved</h3>
						<p><font size="4px">When the needle is inserted, you may feel uncomfortable but shouldn’t while the blood is being drawn. If your arm feels sore after donating, consider taking an over-the-counter pain reliver with acetaminophen to alleviate the achiness. There’s a chance you may feel some weakness in the arm where you donated as well, so try to avoid physical activity or heavy lifting for at least five hours.</font></p>
						<p><font size="4px">5. It Doesn’t Have to be a One-Time Gift Donation can be a single, whole blood donation (red cells, plasma and platelets) or an apheresis donation, where one component of blood, such as red cells or platelets, is shared and the other components are returned to the donor. Whole blood donations can be made every eight weeks, up to six times per year.</font></p>
